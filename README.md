An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) remains a cornerstone of 
cybersecurity, acting as a detecting technology against unauthorized access, 
malicious activity, and potential security breaches in computer systems and 
networks systems internally real-time operational IDS network or Monitors the 
system effectively and analyzes activity, immediate detection and response to 
any suspicious or abnormal behavior. It does so through two main mechanisms 
this: signature detection, where pre-defined attack signatures or patterns are 
compared to detected activity, and anomaly-based. Description, providing a 
baseline for appropriate behavior and flagging any cycles, IDS can be  
classified by two types and those are Network Intrusion Detection systems 
(NIDS) and Host-based Network Detection Systems (HIDS), respectively

## 1.2.1 BEHAIVIOUR OF IDS 
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a pivotal cybersecurity 
implement that monitorial network and system nervosum to identify potential 
threats. It consists of sensors, an analysis engine, alerting mechanisms, and, in 
some cases, a response module. Sensors collect data, while the analysis engine 
compares it to known threat patterns or anomalies. Alerts are triggered upon 
detecting suspicious activity, notifying administrators or automated systems. 
Signature-based IDS uses known threat signatures, anomaly-based IDS 
establishes behavior baselines, and hybrid IDS combines both approaches.  
Network-depend IDS monitorial connection traffic, while host-based IDS 
focuses on individual devices. Challenges include balancing detection accuracy 
and minimizing false alerts, adapting to evolving threats, and addressing 
privacy concerns with encrypted traffic. IDS plays a indispensable role in 
proactively maintaining safeness to the network and systems, requiring 
continuous monitoring, regular updates, and timely responses to potential 
threats.

Step 1: Forward Request: In the first phase, a network packet or message is sent 
to the NIDS for inspection. This packet originates from a device in the network 
and is typically captured by a network tap or other data collector. 
Step 2: Processed Request: The NIDS receives the transmitted packet and 
initiates the intrusion detection process. It extracts contextual information from 
the packet, like payload data, protocol, port numbers, source and destination IP 
addresses, etc. 
Step 3: Check Signature: NIDS compares the extracted information to a 
database of known attack signatures. These signatures are examples of network 
traffic associated with a specific attack. If the NIDS matches the signature, it 
moves on to the next step. 
Step 4: Signature matching: When NIDS finds a matching signature, confirm 
that an attack is likely. It re-analyzes the packet to gather additional evidence 
and assess the severity of the attack. 
Step 5: Intrusion Introduction: NIDS identifies specific attacks based on 
signature matching and other analysis. It identifies the source of the attack, such 
as a specific port or protocol, and the potential impact of the attack. 
Step 6: Review Submission: Once an intrusion is detected, NIDS triggers an 
alarm or notification to alert the network administrator or security team. This 
information provides information about the detected attacks, including the 
cause and impact of the attack

## 3.4 EVALUTION MATRIX

Calculation of the generated classification models is a 
crucial state, which involves the utilization of various Evaluation Metrics. The 
The metrics listed below are used for assessment: 
1. True Positives (TP): This shows how many malicious packets have been 
accurately classified overall. 
2. True Negatives (TN): The entire count of packets that are accurately 
categorized as normal is what this refers to. 
3. False Positives (FP): The number of malicious packets that are mistakenly 
categorized as attacks is indicated by this. 
23 
4. False Negatives (FN): This represents the total amount of malicious packets 
that are mistakenly identified as legitimate. 
The most popular metric for assessing a model is classification accuracy, 
however this does not accurately indicate how well the model will perform. By 
dividing the number of correctly classified samples by the total number of input 
samples, the appropriate classification ratio can be found.
